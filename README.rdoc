= ActionmailerX509

Allows you to send X509 signed and/or crypted mails for Ruby on Rails. Also my you possibility verify and decrypt X509 signed and/or crypted mails.

It has been tested with Rails 3.2.12.

== Creation of the certificates

(1) Generate your own Certificate Authority (CA).

  openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
  openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

(2) Generate a server key and request for signing (csr).

  Note : use your email address for the Common Name (CN) field

  openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096
  openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

(3) Sign the certificate signing request (csr) with the self-created
    certificate authority (CA) that you made earlier.

  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt

(3 bis) or self sign your certificate with the same key.

  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

(4) Compute all thoses files into a PCKS#12 file (so you can include it in your mailer):

  openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.crt -inkey server.key -certfile ca.key -name "My Cert" -out name-cert.p12

== Extracting the files from a PKCS#12 file

If you have a PKCS#12 file, usualy named .p12, you can extract the required files with
the following commands.

(1) Extract the private key

  openssl pkcs12 -in file_input.p12 -clcerts -nocerts -out file_out.key -nodes

(2) Extract the certificate

  openssl pkcs12 -in file_input.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out file_out.crt -nodes

Please note the -nodes to leave the private key uncrypted, use -des if you wish
to protect it.

== INSTALLING

Put this line in your Gemfile

    gem 'actionmailer_x509'

== USING

First for all - run install generator, which adds configuration file

    rails g action_mailer_x509:install

After the process, add base configurations for emails processing in '/config/initializers/x509_settings'

  config.add_configuration :demo,
                           {
                               sign_enable: false,
                               crypt_enable: true,
                               sign_cert: 'cert.crt',
                               sign_key: 'cert.key',
                               sign_passphrase: 'demo',
                               crypt_cert: 'cert.crt',
                               crypt_key: 'cert.key',
                               crypt_passphrase: 'demo',
                               certs_path: Rails.root.join('certs')
                           }

  config.add_configuration :none,
                           {
                               sign_enable: false,
                               crypt_enable: false,
                           }

and set default configuration

  config.default_configuration = :hisp

You may also add the configurations dynamically in any place.

And you may also change the default configuration in any place of the program:

1) Change globally

   ActionMailerX509.default_configuration = :demo

2) Change only for decoding and verifyng if you use Mail object

   Mail.new(encoded_text).proceed(configuration)

If you set configuration as nil in "proceed" func, "ActionMailerX509.default_configuration" will be used.

== HELPERS

You may use some helpers for fast encoding in case when you proceed received email. Helper has the following signature:

   method_name_as_new_encoding

For example:

   mail = Mail.new(raw_email)
   mail.body                => return body in default encoding
   mail.body_as_koi8_r      => return body in koi8-r encoding

== USING TEST

You mau use rspec tests by command

   bundle exec rake

or use next rake tests:

Start all main tests

  rake action_mailer_x509:all

You can benchmark the gem with:

  rake action_mailer_x509:performance_test

Send yourself a signed email with:

  rake action_mailer_x509:send_test

Verify the gem which generates valid signature

  rake action_mailer_x509:verify_signature

Generate a signed email in a local file

  rake action_mailer_x509:generate_mail

Generates a crypted mail in a file

  rake action_mailer_x509:generate_crypted_mail

Verify the gem which generates valid encrypted mail

  rake action_mailer_x509:verify_crypt

Check if crypt text is valid by openssl

  rake action_mailer_x509:verify_crypt_by_openssl

Check sign and crypt

  rake action_mailer_x509:verify_sign_and_crypt

== REQUIREMENTS
